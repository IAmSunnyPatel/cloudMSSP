# Cloud Based Managed Security Service Provider #

#### This is just a basic overview of tools we have used in our project ####

### Tools Used ###

* AWS 
* MYSQL
* PHP
* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* COCKPIT
* NESSUS 

We have implemented 2 cyber security tools that protects our client from any cyber attacks. Here are the view of that tools and some basic information on what they does

# Cockpit #

Open-source, lightweight software called Cockpit lets users control Linux via a web interface. This is especially useful for individuals who run Linux with a CLI.

It allows users to update rapidly, allow services, restart the system, use Docker containers, and control the network and storage. It also gives a web-based terminal to send codes remotely on a server.

# Nessus # 

Nessus is a remote security scanning tool, which scans a computer and raises an alert if it discovers any vulnerabilities that malicious hackers could use to gain access to any computer you have connected to a network.  It does this by running over 1200 checks on a given computer, testing to see if any of these attacks could be used to break into the computer or otherwise harm it.

If you are an administrator in charge of any computer (or group of computers) connected to the internet, Nessus is a great tool help keep their domains free of the easy vulnerabilities that hackers and viruses commonly look to exploit.
